# Task ID: 8
# Title: Build Personalized Problem Recommendation Engine
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build an AI-powered recommendation system to suggest optimal problems to users based on their skill and history.
# Details:
Implement a hybrid model combining collaborative filtering (matrix factorization) and content-based approaches. Use deep learning embeddings to match users with problems based on skill level, history, and learning objectives.

# Test Strategy:
Offline evaluation of the recommendation model using historical data (precision, recall). A/B testing with a control group to measure the effectiveness of recommendations on user engagement and skill improvement.
