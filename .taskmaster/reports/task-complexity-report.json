			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Contest Management Module",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Given the goal of creating a full-stack Contest Management module, expand the existing 5 subtasks. For each subtask, detail the specific implementation steps, required data structures, API contracts, and potential edge cases to consider. For backend tasks, specify GoLang struct definitions and handler logic. For frontend tasks, describe Astro component props, state management, and API interactions.",
			"reasoning": "The task is a full-stack feature with significant backend logic (state transitions, access control) and multiple frontend views. The complexity comes from integrating these parts correctly, not from novel technical challenges. The 5 subtasks cover the data layer, API layer, and the three key frontend user experiences, which is a comprehensive and appropriate plan."

			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Real-time Leaderboards and Submission Tracking",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Implement Real-time Leaderboards' into 6 subtasks. Start with the existing 5, but split 'Load Testing and Optimization' into two distinct subtasks: 'Develop Load Testing Suite' and 'Execute Performance Tuning Cycles'. For each subtask, detail the technical specifications, including Supabase RLS policies, PostgreSQL aggregation function logic, Astro component state management for real-time updates, and specific scenarios for the load testing scripts.",
			"reasoning": "The task's complexity is driven by the high-concurrency real-time requirement (20,000+ users) and the need for efficient data aggregation. The 'Load Testing and Optimization' subtask is critical and complex enough to be its own major effort, involving multiple cycles of testing and tuning. Splitting it would better reflect the work involved and de-risk the implementation."

		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Advanced Code Editor",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand on the 5 subtasks for integrating the Monaco Editor. For each subtask, provide code-level guidance. Specify the necessary Vite/Astro configuration for the bundler plugin, provide example Monaco editor initialization options for themes and language features, detail the CSS and editor options needed for mobile responsiveness, and outline a comprehensive cross-browser test plan.",
			"reasoning": "The complexity lies in the details of the Monaco Editor API and its integration with Astro's build process and client-side hydration model ('Islands'). The provided 5 subtasks correctly identify the key challenges: initial setup, feature configuration (languages, IntelliSense), and cross-platform usability (mobile). The breakdown is logical and covers all major aspects."

			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Develop AI-Powered User Performance Analytics",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the 'AI-Powered User Performance Analytics' task into 6 subtasks. Split the 'Develop the Core Bayesian Skill Progression Model' subtask into 'Research and Prototype Bayesian Model' and 'Implement and Validate Production Model'. For each of the 6 subtasks, detail the technical requirements. Specify the database schema for the time-series metrics, the architecture of the ingestion pipeline, the mathematical formulation of the model, the API specifications, and the data structures for frontend visualization.",
			"reasoning": "This task is highly complex due to its data engineering and data science nature. The core of this complexity is the Bayesian model itself, which involves statistical expertise, prototyping, and validation. The current subtask breakdown under-represents this R&D effort. Separating the research/prototyping phase from the production implementation creates a more realistic project plan."

		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Build Personalized Problem Recommendation Engine",
			"complexityScore": 10,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the 'Personalized Problem Recommendation Engine' task into 7 subtasks. Add dedicated subtasks for 'Offline Model Evaluation and Comparison' and 'A/B Testing Infrastructure and Integration'. For each subtask, provide detailed specifications. Describe the feature engineering process, the architectures for the deep learning and matrix factorization models, the hybrid ranking model's design, the specific offline evaluation metrics (nDCG, precision@k), and the API design for serving recommendations.",
			"reasoning": "This task's complexity is extremely high, requiring the development and integration of three separate ML models (content-based, collaborative filtering, hybrid ranker). The current subtasks outline model creation but implicitly bundle evaluation. Explicitly creating subtasks for 'Offline Model Evaluation' and 'A/B Testing Framework' is crucial for a project of this nature, as validation is as important and complex as the model building itself."

		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Enhance Judge System Security and Scalability",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the 5 subtasks for enhancing the Judge System. For each subtask, provide detailed implementation instructions. Specify the Dockerfile structure, the seccomp-bpf profiles for each language, the Kubernetes manifest files (Deployment, HPA, KEDA ScaledObject), and a detailed plan for both the penetration testing (e.g., list of exploits to try) and load testing (e.g., simulation profile).",
			"reasoning": "The task is complex due to the specialized knowledge required in container orchestration (Kubernetes), auto-scaling (HPA/KEDA), and low-level system security (seccomp, Isolate). The 5 subtasks provide a logical progression from containerizing the application to deploying, scaling, and finally testing it, covering all critical aspects of the enhancement in a well-structured manner."

		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Set Up Comprehensive Monitoring and Observability",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the 5 subtasks for setting up monitoring and observability. For each subtask, provide specific implementation details. List the key metrics to be exported from each GoLang service (e.g., RED method: Rate, Errors, Duration). Detail the OpenTelemetry instrumentation points, including context propagation through the Asynq queue. Design the layout for the primary Grafana dashboard and define the PromQL queries for at least three critical alerts.",
			"reasoning": "The complexity lies in the breadth of the task, as it requires touching every service to add instrumentation, and the depth required to make the collected data truly useful (e.g., meaningful dashboards and non-flaky alerts). The 5 subtasks perfectly map to the standard industry workflow for implementing an observability stack: set up tools, generate data, trace requests, visualize, and alert."
