# Task ID: 10
# Title: Set Up Comprehensive Monitoring and Observability
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 3
# Priority: low
# Description: Set up a full monitoring, logging, and alerting stack to ensure system reliability, performance, and 99.9% uptime.
# Details:
Integrate Prometheus and Grafana for system metrics (API latency <100ms, error rates, resource usage). Use OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing across services. Configure real-time alerts for critical issues like high latency or submission queue backup.

# Test Strategy:
Validate that metrics are correctly collected and displayed in Grafana dashboards. Trigger alerts intentionally to test the notification pipeline. Review logs during load tests to identify performance bottlenecks.
