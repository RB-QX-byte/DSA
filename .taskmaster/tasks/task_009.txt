# Task ID: 9
# Title: Enhance Judge System Security and Scalability
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: low
# Description: Harden the security of the code execution environment and prepare the infrastructure for large-scale traffic, as part of Phase 4.
# Details:
Implement a dual-layer sandbox (Isolate + Docker). Enforce resource limits with cgroups, disk quotas, and use seccomp-bpf for system call filtering. Configure horizontal scaling for judge workers using Kubernetes with auto-scaling policies based on queue depth.

# Test Strategy:
Penetration testing against the sandbox environment. Load testing to verify auto-scaling functionality and determine the maximum concurrent submission throughput while maintaining sub-5-second execution times.
