# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement Basic Code Execution Judge System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the initial version of the secure code execution judge system to process submissions.
# Details:
Set up a distributed worker pool using Asynq (Redis-based queue). Implement the primary sandboxing layer with 'Isolate' for resource control. The system should support a limited set of languages and execute code against predefined test cases, returning a verdict.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for the judge's logic (compilation, execution, comparison). Integration tests for the submission pipeline from API to judge worker and back. Security testing against simple malicious code attempts.
